                        <p>1. Rule 0, aka "The GM is always right." - You might hear this "rule" in many places, and at first glance it might seem heavy handed and destructive. Let's be clear, your job as GM is not to be an opponent for your players.
                            Your job is to be part of telling a cooperative story, and take care of all the NPCs, monsters, traps, and plot points the players will encounter. In this case, what Rule 0 (aka The GM is Always Right) means is that you
                            don't need to worry about the rules, or the text of an adventure, verbatim. If, during a session, something comes up in game and you're not sure what rule applies, or how a rule might apply, you can either stop the game
                            and look up the rule (and debate it with the players), or you can make a ruling on the spot for the sake of keeping the game flowing. I vote for the second option. Make it clear to the players that you are making a ruling
                            now, and will check the rule later, just keep the game going! After the session you can look up the rule and parse it out. If you got it wrong, no big deal. Next session you can tell the players what you learned and let
                            them know that going forward if the same situation comes up you will all follow the rule as you've learned it to be. The same can be said for adventures. If you're playing through a published adventure and make a mistake,
                            no big deal! You can retcon it later, or just change the story to fit the mistake. The Adventure as written is not the law! You can make it your own. Rule 0. <br> <a href="#">Read More . . .</a></p>

                        <h1>Dungeons & Dragons</h1>
                        <p>The first Dungeons & Dragons game was played back when Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson chose to personalize the massive battles of their fantasy wargames with the exploits of individual heroes. This inspiration became the first
                            fantasy roleplaying game, in which players are characters in an ongoing fantasy story. This new kind of game has become immensely popular over the years, and D&D has grown to include many new ways to vividly experience
                            worlds of heroic fantasy.</p>

                        <p>The game’s plots are designed to challenge the investigators. Each adventure is different, but your investigator is always at risk of becoming injured, suffering sanity-shattering experiences, or even be eaten by a monster!
                            As the game progresses, investigators can gain secret knowledge from arcane books about the monsters and dark forces of the Cthulhu Mythos, as well as advancement in their skills as they become more experienced.</p>

                        <p>Informally nicknamed D&D version 3.75, Pathfinder is a modification of version 3.5 of Dungeons & Dragons, and is intended to be compatible with the older game. Lead Designer Jason Bulhman felt that the basic classes of D&D
                            version 3.5 were lackluster, as they did not provide incentive to stay with a single class for 20 levels of play. Pathfinder adds many options to the classes and boosts their abilities in their core roles.</p>

                        <p>The game is set in a dystopian future city which is controlled by an artificial intelligence construct called The Computer (also known as 'Friend Computer'), and where information (including the game rules) are restricted
                            by color-coded security clearance. Players are initially enforcers of The Computer's authority (known as 'Troubleshooters', mainly for the fact that they shoot trouble), and will be given missions to seek out and eliminate
                            threats to The Computer's control.</p>

                                take on. Even then, the resistances and immunities the Tarrasque has, along with its gargantuan health pool and sizeable damage per round, this creature will take down a few players before it is taken down itself.</p>

                                however, Yig can rapidly invade the mind of investigators, dropping their sanity and causing them to turn on each other in a display of madness and mayhem.</p>

                            <p>Heralding from Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, Nightwalkers are terrifying creatures that seek to destroy all life they come across. While the conditions for summoning a Nightwalker are difficult to meet, doing so can
